# Binary Fun

When I say fun, I don't mean you are necessarily going to laugh, unless its at my attempts at so called 'programming'.

Here be a series of C files each illustrating a facet of binary integer manipulation which might be useful if you have processor intensive code squirreled away in nested loops somewhere.

## Who are you?

ME : ex LAMP dev who winged his way around for 20 years or so, from middle age to old age - only being rumbled once or twice.  Then someone introduced me to  Micro Controllers (yes, you know who you are Anthony). As a big believer in premature optimization being evil etc, got POEAA on the bookshelf and all that, and ...

SUDDENLY thats all to one side, because now processor cycles DO matter, 

+they eat battery up 
+vociferous code eats up precious tiny memory

So I thought I'd better stop, learn C properly, get 'closer to the metal' and all that jazz. Then it makes sense to grok binary / bitwise ops because now I understand about uController ports and I/O. Hence I ploughed merrily thru "Hackers Delight", and thought I'd share what I learned and leave it hanging around the web in case I need it when being remote somewhere.

YOU : might be similar, or are just struggling to understand all the palava about binary and bitwise.  These files might help, I hope so.

Maybe you want an accompaniment to your own digestion of "Hackers Delight".
